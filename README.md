Experiment to implement react-style component classes in the most basic way with mainly browser builtin features
 
Just rendering, nothing about state managing or similar.


 
 
used npm packages

+-- rollup@0.26.3  extraneous
+-- rollup-plugin-filesize@0.3.4  extraneous
+-- rollup-plugin-includepaths@0.1.5  extraneous

they are just for having working support for `import/export`.

Also tried out x-tag, but it does not offer a nice class based api.
